# EmailSender
This is a Java project for sending email using Gmail smtp server.

While making executable jar with Run Configuration of SSLEmail.java, you should name the exporting jar as "EmailSender-ssl.jar". Copy the docs folder and image folder to the same path which you export the executable jar. Run the jar at CMD with "java -jar EmailSender-ssl.jar".

Similar steps can be done for TLSEmail.java class.

You can choose one of jars you build before.
